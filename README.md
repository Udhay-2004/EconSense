# EconSense
Econsense is a software solution designed to empower businesses, investors, and policymakers with valuable insights and predictions regarding economic downturns.The software utilizes a wide range of economic indicators, such as GDP growth, unemployment rates, stock market performance, consumer sentiment indexes, interest rates, and inflation rates. These indicators are collected and processed to identify historical patterns and correlations that precede economic downturns.Through a combination of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model development, Econsense generates predictions and probability scores for the likelihood of an economic downturn in the near future. These predictions serve as an early warning system, enabling users to take proactive measures, adjust investment strategies, and implement appropriate policies to mitigate the impact of downturns.
